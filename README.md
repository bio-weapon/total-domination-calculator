# Total Domination: Nuclear Strategy Battle Calculator

1. Enter attacking unit amounts and their bonuses (if known)
2. Enter defending unit amounts and their bonuses (if known)

The battles are very accurate, but there are no fleet battle groups yet and it's missing A-units. I won't be adding Elite Units since they are negligible in differences even taking into account fleet battle groups.

I'll update it in the future and also add sector defense bonuses as they are quite important actually.
